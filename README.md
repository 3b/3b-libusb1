# 3b-libusb1 - (incomplete) Common Lisp/CFFI bindings for [libusb][] 1.0

So far, only implemented enough to download files from my camera, so
expect lots of missing features. Low-level bindings will probably be
replaced by autogenerated bindings at some point, and high-level API
will probably change as well if it ever gets used more.

see https://github.com/3b/lytro-dl/blob/master/protocol-usb.lisp for example usage
